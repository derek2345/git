# Know Roaming


author: Derek Galbraith

The task was completed as a Java Application using MySql and the jdbc driver. A local or a remote MySql 
database and the jdbc jar file / driver are required to run this project. A link to download the jdbc file
is available in the email also submitted with this project.

In order to run this project it must be able to connect to a MySql database: 
 - The user will be prompted whether they would like to connect to a local or a remote database. 
 - The user will either be asked for a port number or remote url.
 - The user will be asked for an ssl key, this is not required and will be assumed "false" if left blank.
 - The user will be asked for a username.
 - The user will be asked for a password.
 
 The rest of the functionality is as outlined in the document.
 
 When not entering data or responding to a (y/n) question; the "exit" command should be available.
 
 Some debugging code has been left in but commented out.
